Neural networks are machine learning models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain. These models consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process data, learn patterns and enable tasks such as pattern recognition and decision-making.

###  Architecture of Neural Network
- Input layer : Input layer is the part of neural network which takes input features from the training data . The number of neurons in input layer are equal to the no of features in the input data . For example, if the input data's are [height, age, BMI] which are three then the no of input neurons in the input layer are 3.
- Hidden Layer: A neural network can have one or more number of hidden layers in it. All the mathematical calculations and important pattern recognition work are learned in this part of layers. You can define N number of hidden layer.
- Output Layer: The output layer is the final layer where predicted output of the model is carried out. The format of these outputs varies depending on the specific task like classification, regression.
